# Merisi

Merisi is a event management plugin for WordPress. It is developped for a French
cultural assocation called Polychrome. It was named after Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio.

The plugin adds two custom post types: events and locations.

## To-do

- [x] Add (better) custom types backward-compatible with wpEventful
- [x] Add a metabox
- [ ] Add an "event type" taxonomy and field in the metabox
- [ ] Localize the plugin (especially in French)
- [ ] Improve location management
- [ ] Add a third custom post type associated to events: audio archives
